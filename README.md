# Image and Video Analysis and Technology

This repo contains the python notebooks for the lab exercises of the course "Image and Video Analysis and Technology", which is part of the ECE-NTUA undergraduate program (8nth semester).

Course Description

The course includes theoretical analysis and laboratory exercises in the field of processing, analysis, management, transmission, access and retrieval of both digital images and digital video, which is the most complex structure in modern multimedia systems. Topics covered: analysis of image and video characteristics, digitization process (sampling, quantization), image transformations, coding and transmission techniques of still and moving images, image and video analysis, with non-application linear filters, mainly for feature extraction and categorization, deep learning architectures (CNN,GAN) for image classification and recognition. In the laboratory part, the systems of coding, compression, analysis and management of images and videos are analyzed, with emphasis on the standards JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, MPEG7, MPEG21 and in modern applications with deep learning architectures.
